# ShareOxide

A simple, self-hosted Rust URL shortener and temporary file upload service (soon), with OpenID Connect authentication built-in.

It has been made for use with [Authentik](https://goauthentik.io). If you experience issues with other identity providers, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/GGORG0/shareoxide/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/GGORG0/shareoxide/pulls).

## Demo instance

A demo instance is available at <https://shareoxide.ggorg.xyz>. You can log in with the user `demo` (password: `demo`) or create a new one.

## API

A Scalar UI for browsing the API docs is available at <https://shareoxide.ggorg.xyz/apidoc/scalar>. Please note that you have to be logged in to use the built-in API tester, otherwise you'll just get a generic-looking error.
